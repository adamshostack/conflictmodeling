# 2. What Can Go Wrong?

This question is at the heart of technology threat modeling, and our tools, such as attack trees, can be adopted to conflict.  In "[Transforming Tech with Diversity-friendly software](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JB3bTbJvjEypKlPu1JKV20Oz9YlF5zRCl3vLIPdDTrA/edit#slide=id.g2073602466_0_140)" Jon Pincus presented an attack tree for harrassing a person.  This is a way of investigating the question of "what can go wrong."  His tree is:

![A threat tree for harrassment comprised of triggering, flooding and making them look bad](https://github.com/adamshostack/conflictmodeling/blob/master/images/Harrassment-attack-tree-by-Pincus.png)

My current model is that there's interpersonal attacks and attacks by
nations or other large groups, although nations use interpersonal
attacks, there are things, such as election interference, that are
uncommon in interpersonal conflict.

# A taxonomy of images
Conflict over images seems to run eternal.  From Nazi flags to nipples, image content is a constant battlefield.  This list is to provoke thinking about the range of issues presented with images, not to suggest solutions.

1. Clothing/lack thereof
     1. Full nudity with consent of the model
     2. breasts/breastfeeding/female-presenting breasts
     3. Lack of burqa or other covering
2. Symbols
     1. Swastikas (banned in Germany, offensive in other places, sacred to Hindus)
     2. Controversial (eg, Confederate flags)
     3. Other political symbols either banned or offensive, and also meaningful
3. Behavior/action
    1. Murder videos
    2. incitement to criminal acts/terror
    3. Pornography (filmed/photographed)
    4. Pornography (surriptitious/revenge)
4. Representations
    1. Racial stereotypes
    2. Regligious stereotypes
    3. Representations of people (the prophet Mohammed)
     

# A taxonomy by actor

## Interpersonal attacks
(This is very, very incomplete)

Attacks: race, religion, sex, threats, politics, trolling, harrassment, libel.
Attacks outside the US might also include lesse-Majeste, blasphemy, or political advocacy.

## Attacks by nation states

### Fake news
There's work to mine by at least Kate Starbird and Craig Silverman.

### Elections 
At Facebook's F8 Conference in 2018, Alex Stamos presented a taxomony:
* Attacks on knowledge including amplification of fake messages
* Safety of elections: harrassment, account takeover, threats of violence against voters, candidates, election officials
* attempts to disenfranchise/reduce turnout
