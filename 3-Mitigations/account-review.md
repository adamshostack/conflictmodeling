# Account Review
Account review is a blanket term for human decision making when an account is flagged.  Review systems are controversial because they can appear arbitrary, they often involve reduced access, and they don't always result in the decision that a reporter wants.

Decisions to be made include:
1. Triggers Flagging can happen because of customer complaints, government actions or internal systems such as ML raising concerns.
2. Review process.
3. Transparency. How much of what happens in review is specified for the public?  More transparency may lead to gaming; less leads to confusion, accusations of Kafka-esque process.
4. Appeals
