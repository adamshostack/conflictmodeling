# Managing Potentially Problematic Content

Choices you have include, but are not limited to:

1. Banning certain words/content
2. AI/ML to flag content that meets certain criteria
3. Reporting systems

## Banned word lists
Pros: Simple, predictable
Cons: Real life is not so easy.  See [Zunger17](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/asking-the-right-questions-about-ai-7ed2d9820c48) and search for Jay-Z
