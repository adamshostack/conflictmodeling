# Managing Potentially Problematic Content

Choices you have include, but are not limited to:

1. Banning certain words/content
2. AI/ML to flag content that meets certain criteria
3. Reporting systems
4. Behaviour based controls
5. Rate limiting

## Banned word lists
Pros: Simple, predictable

Cons: 
* Real life is not so simple.  See [Zunger17](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/asking-the-right-questions-about-ai-7ed2d9820c48) and search for Jay-Z
* You will be accused of censorship.
NOTE: You could alter / tag content based on word list(s) to help further controls



## Reporting systems
Reporting systems range from Twitter/Facebook-style "flag this content" buttons to DMCA-style reporting.


## Rate limiting
Pros: Stop the spread of fake news.
Cons: Stop activists from organizing the next Arab Spring.  Suddenly popular accounts may be popular for positive reasons.
